# DJ1hAD0
This algorithm generates a list of passwords that are accepted by DJ1hAD0's executable.
I know this algorithm might not be the best but it worked for me and was acceptable regarding speed.

DumbBruteforceWithName: You can specify a string the algorithm searches for passwords that start with this string:
	Example: If you want a password that starts with potato, run bruteForce with "otato" as last parameter, remember the executable ignores the first character.
	I alread searched some example passwords. Check out the bruteforced_passwords directory:
	banana
	github
	iloveyou
	luxdav
	LuxXx
	ollydbg
	password
	potato
